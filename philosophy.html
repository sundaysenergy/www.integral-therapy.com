        It is easy to lose one's sense of balance and serenity in the turbulence of 21st century American culture. But, &quot;growth comes through struggle,&quot; as Martin Luther King once said. If we can gather the courage to face our difficulties, we can learn from them, come to understand ourselves better, and grow stronger, wiser, and more balanced. Having a patient, understanding, non-judgmental guide through this terrain can often help immeasurably.

        Our work with clients is based upon the integration of a number of schools of psychology and other wisdom traditions.
      </p>
      <p>
      <u>These include</u>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="jungianpsychology.html">Jungian psychology</a></li>
        <li><a href="relationalpsychoanalysis.html" title="Relational Psychoanalysis">Relational Psychoanalysis</a></li>
        <li>Integral theory</li>
        <li>Mindfulness practice</li>
        <li>The world's religions and spiritual traditions</li>
        <li>The arts, literature and philosophy--wellspring of the human psyche </li>
        <li>Existential psychology</li>
        <li>Developmental theory and the recent discoveries in neuroscience</li>
        <li>Play therapy </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        However, despite this broad bed of psychological wisdom, recognition of the uniqueness of each individual is paramount. Because of this, we enter into work with each client with an open mind, a sense of humility, and a recognition that everyone holds their own keys to healing. We believe that with patient, caring collaboration, together we will find the right path.

        <em>...[M]edicine is and has always been an art... True art is creation, and creation is beyond all theories. That is why I say to any beginner: Learn your theories as well as you can, but put them aside when you touch the miracle of the living soul. </em>

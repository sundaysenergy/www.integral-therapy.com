All humans' lives go through periods of challenge and difficulty. Without struggle there would be no growth. Our aim is to help people of any age: 

* Better understand themselves and their struggles to enable growth
* Regain a sense of balance and peace of mind
* Build more satisfying relationships and more effective communication
* Find the sense of direction and meaning that allows one to thrive.

### Cost:

Reduced rates and sliding scale fees are available to make services affordable for all income levels.  The range is $30 - $125 depending on what is affordable for the client.  We usually do not accept insurance to minimize our adminsistrative costs thus keeping prices down for all clients.  Occassionally we make exceptions to this, as we are in-network with most insurance companies.

### Scheduling:

Appointments are available weekdays, evenings, and weekends. [Contact us](/contact) to set up an appointment.
